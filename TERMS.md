# Internet Identity Sale Contract v1.0 — Terms of Use

Last updated: 2026-02-11

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern interaction with a deployed instance of the Internet Identity Sale smart contract canister (the "Contract").

By interacting with the Contract in any manner — including through direct canister calls, scripts, user interfaces, or third-party tools — you agree to be bound by these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not interact with the Contract.

## 1. Nature of the Contract

The Contract is autonomous on-chain code.

The Contract operates solely according to its deployed on-chain code and applicable protocol rules, without discretion, intervention, or control by any off-chain party, except to the extent that such ability is explicitly provided by the deployed on-chain code itself.

## 2. Code Is the Sole Source of Truth

The deployed on-chain code of the Contract is the sole source of truth regarding its functionality, behavior, parameters, limitations, and outcomes.

No off-chain materials — including documentation, interfaces, descriptions, FAQs, announcements, validation outputs, certificates, labels, posts, communications, or community statements — are binding or authoritative.

If there is any inconsistency between these Terms and the Contract's deployed on-chain code, the deployed on-chain code controls.

No off-chain statement or material can modify, supplement, override, or create obligations inconsistent with the deployed on-chain code, and any expectation formed outside the deployed on-chain code is legally irrelevant to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 3. No Off-Chain Party or Control

No off-chain person or entity, including the developers of the Contract's template or any persons or entities involved in the operation or governance of the Hub, is a party to any interaction or transaction executed by the Contract.

No off-chain party can access, modify, reverse, halt, or intervene in the Contract's operation, except to the extent that the deployed on-chain code explicitly provides a mechanism to do so.

## 4. No Regulatory or Financial Services

Nothing in the Contract is intended to constitute the provision of regulated financial services, exchange services, brokerage, escrow, marketplace operations, investment services, or any other regulated activity.

## 5. No Legal Relationships Between Users

Interaction with the Contract does not create any partnership, agency, joint venture, or fiduciary relationship between users.

To the extent any contractual or legal relationship arises between users as a result of their interaction with the Contract, it exists solely between those users. Neither the template developers nor the GeekFactory Smart Contract Hub or its governance assume any responsibility or liability for such relationships.

## 6. Assumption of Risk

Interaction with the Contract involves significant technical, legal, and economic risks, including irreversible loss of assets, access, control, data, or other rights.

Interaction with the Contract may result in the transfer or change of control over digital identities, credentials, or access that may be linked to external services, obligations, restrictions, or third-party systems.

By interacting with the Contract, you knowingly and voluntarily assume all such risks.

## 7. Irreversibility and Finality

All actions performed through the Contract are executed on-chain and are irreversible by design.

The Contract provides no mechanism for refunds, rollbacks, reversals, compensation, dispute resolution, or remediation, except to the extent that any such mechanism is explicitly provided by the deployed on-chain code itself.

## 8. Disclaimer

The Contract is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no liability shall arise for any loss, damage, or harm resulting from interaction with the Contract for any developers of the Contract's template or any persons or entities involved in the operation or governance of the Hub.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability to the extent such liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless any persons or entities associated with the development, deployment, publication, or availability of the Contract from third-party claims arising from your interaction with the Contract, including claims arising from your violation of applicable laws or the rights of third parties.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to the Contract or its use shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Cyprus.

## 12. Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement governing interaction with the Contract.
